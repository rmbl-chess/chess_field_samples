## Field-collected attributes of trees sampled as part of the 2025 Colorado Headwaters Ecological Spectroscopy Study field campaign.			
## This dataset represents individual trees visited in the field by the CHESS team in June and July 2025. Digital data was collected on tablet computers using iForm digital forms. Data has been QC'd by manual comparison to plot photos and other ancilliary data.

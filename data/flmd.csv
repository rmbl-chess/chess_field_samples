chess_meadow_cover_cleaned.csv,"Species and functional type cover estimates for meadow samples collected in the field as part of the 2025 Colorado Headwaters Ecological Spectroscopy Study field campaign. This file contains percent horizontal cover information for vegetation and non-vegetation categories. Plant species that have >=10% horizontal cover are identified to species, while plants with less than 10% cover are combined by functional group. This dataset is presented in a ""long"" format (one cover estimate per row). Additional attributes collected in the field for each site is stored in a separate file (""chess_meadow_site_cleaned.csv"").  This data has been QC'd for internal consistency and links to other datasets.",ESS-DIVE CSV v1
chess_meadow_site_cleaned.csv,"Field-collected attributes of meadow vegetation samples collected as part of the 2025 Colorado Headwaters Ecological Spectroscopy Study field campaign. This file represents plot-level attributes of 1m^2 quadrats, collected in the field as a digital form using iForm software. This data has been QC'd for internal consistency and links to other datasets.",ESS-DIVE CSV v1
chess_shrub_site_cleaned.csv,Field-collected attributes of shrub vegetation samples collected as part of the 2025 Colorado Headwaters Ecological Spectroscopy Study field campaign. This file represents plot-level attributes of shrubs (woody plants with canopies greater than 1m^2 and up to 3 m tall). Attribute data was collected in the field as a digital form using iForm software. This data has been QC'd for internal consistency and links to other datasets.,ESS-DIVE CSV v1
chess_species_list_cleaned.csv,"Species list for the 2025 Colorado Headwaters Ecological Spectroscopy Study field campaign. This dataset represents taxa referenced in field datasets collected as part of the CHESS campaign in June and July of 2025. All individuals were identified to species, and all species were referenced to GBIF accepted entities as of January 12th, 2026. This data was last updated on January 21st, 2026.",ESS-DIVE CSV v1
chess_tree_site_cleaned.csv,Field-collected attributes of trees sampled as part of the 2025 Colorado Headwaters Ecological Spectroscopy Study field campaign. This file represents individual trees visited in the field by the CHESS team in June and July 2025. Digital data was collected on tablet computers using iForm digital forms. Data has been QC'd by manual comparison to plot photos and other ancilliary data.,ESS-DIVE CSV v1
chess_voucher_IDs_cleaned.csv,Voucher sample information for plants collected as part of the 2025 Colorado Headwaters Ecological Spectroscopy Study field campaign. This table represents taxonomic determinations of field specimens collected for laboratory identification. These samples are stored in the herbarium of Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory. A full species list with authority information is stored in a separate table (chess_species_list_cleaned.csv).,ESS-DIVE CSV v1

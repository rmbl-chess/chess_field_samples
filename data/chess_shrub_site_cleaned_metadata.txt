##  Field-collected attributes of shrub vegetation samples collected as part of the 2025 Colorado Headwaters Ecological Spectroscopy Study field campaign.			
## This dataset represents plot-level attributes of shrubs (woody plants with canopies greater than 1m^2 and up to 3 m tall). Attribute data was collected in the field as a digital form using iForm software. This data has been QC'd for internal consistency and links to other datasets.

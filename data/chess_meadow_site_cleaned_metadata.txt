##  Field-collected attributes of meadow vegetation samples collected as part of the 2025 Colorado Headwaters Ecological Spectroscopy Study field campaign.			
"## This dataset represents plot-level attributes of 1m^2 quadrats, collected in the field as a digital form using iForm software. Percent cover information was collected for all plant species with greater than 10% cover as well as other vegetated and non-vegetated cover categories, but this data is stored in a speparate table (""chess_meadow_cover_cleaned.csv""). This data has been QC'd for internal consistency and links to other datasets."
